# This is my first Python Project.
# Let's see how this goes.

name = 'Nanak'
print(name)

# Variables don't start with numbers

# You can declare two variables in one line.
width, height = 400, 500

# User input in Python
Num1 = input('Enter your number: ')
Num2 = input('Enter your second number: ')


# Strings and Numbers in Python
# You have to type cast  the values for example int

# This will give us the concatenated string of 400500.
# But I guess if you just declare them then they act as an integer.
print(Num1 + Num2)

# This will actually give the addition value
print(int(Num1) + int(Num2))
